<h1>Welcome! </h1>

Here you can find all the code that underpins my [personal website](https://andrearsenio.com/) and which I adapted from [Joe Brown's](https://brown.gatech.edu/) with permission.

My main objectives here were: 

1. Have a website that reflects my love for typesetting, and 
2. Is light enough to be accessed on a budget smartphone over a 2G network. 

I hope you like browsing it as much as I enjoyed coding it.
