If you're reading this it means that you 
have some interest in HTML/CSS and that you accept JavaScript as a
necessary evil. EDIT: the website no longer runs JavaScript :))
Me? Well, I'm just learning this stuff and I decided to adapt 
Joe Brown's (https://brown.gatech.edu/) layout with permission,
which I fell in love with because of its simplicity and functionality.
My main objective here was to have a website that reflects my love
for typesetting, my utilitarian approach to work and which is light 
enough to be accessed on a budget smart-phone over a 2G network. So I
hope you like to browse it as much as I enjoyed coding it. -->

					<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>
							Welcome! I am an engineer based in Lisboa, Portugal. I have a very strong interest in urban water systems and in decision making processes regarding water and sanitation infrastructure construction and expansion. I am particularly interested in understand how data can be used to support decision making. 
							<br>
							<br>
							From 2009 until 2013 I worked at <a href="https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/" target="_blank">KWR - Watercycle Research Institute</a> while doing my PhD at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/watermanagement/medewerker/staff-sanitary-engineering/dr-ir-andre-arsenio" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a> (<a href="https://andrearsenio.com/articles/PhD_thesis_file.pdf" download>thesis</a>, <a href="https://andrearsenio.com/articles/PhD_thesis_cover.jpg" download>cover</a>). From 2014 and until the beginning of 2021 I was involved in several innovation, research and capacity building projects throughout Mozambique. At the beginning of 2021 I moved back to Portugal where I started working at AGS.  
							<br>
							<br>
							On this page you can find a sample of my previous projects, and if you would like to get in touch, my direct contacts can be found at the bottom of this page. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
