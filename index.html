Me? Well, I'm just learning this stuff and I decided to adapt 
Joe Brown's (https://brown.gatech.edu/) layout with permission,
which I fell in love with because of its simplicity and functionality.
My main objective here was to have a website that reflects my love
for typesetting, my utilitarian approach to work and which is light 
enough to be accessed on a budget smart-phone over a 2G network. So I
hope you like to browse it as much as I enjoyed coding it. -->

					<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>
							Welcome! I am a researcher and consultant based in Maputo, Mozambique. In my work I aim for integrated approaches for the <a href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/03/19/the-urban-water-cycle-sustaining-our-modern-cities/" target="_blank">Urban Water Cycle</a> - bridging sanitation services, water supply and water resources management - as a sustainable way to address water security and environmental pollution, which are serious challenges for populations and decision makers across the world and,  in particular, in the Global South. I also believe that a combination of academic research, capacity building at various educational levels and innovative approaches to technology and management, forms a solid foundation to leap-frog development.
							<br>
							<br>
							From 2009 until 2013 I worked at <a href="https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/" target="_blank">KWR - Watercycle Research Institute</a> while doing my PhD at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/watermanagement/staff/staff-sanitary-engineering/dr-ir-andre-arsenio/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a>, <a href="/articles/PhD_thesis.pdf" download>here</a> you can download a copy of my final thesis. Since 2014 I have been involved in several projects throughout Mozambique, to where I moved at the end of 2016. 
							<br>
							<br>
							On this page you can find a sample of the projects where I am currently working on, and if you would like to get in touch, my direct contacts can be found at the bottom of this page. I am looking forward to hearing from you!
